/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In the current financial software sector, there is a distinct lack
of open source offerings. The trade order management software sector
is currently dominated by the likes of Tradar, LineData, Charles River,
etc. I wanted to create an open source alternative to these systems. One
that would match the aspirations of the vast majority of young investment
start-ups.

The OpenTOMS system is written in PHP and uses the CakePHP MVC framework.
This will hopefully allow for a broad spectrum of contributors to the project.

We encourage you to participate in this project and to help make it the first
and best open source tool for trade and order management.
